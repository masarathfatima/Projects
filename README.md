Insights to be considered before doing the assessment:

1)Selection of Databases for Tables:
For paid_user_subscriptions, a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL is suitable as its a structured subscription data.
For stream_logs capturing streaming activity, a NoSQL database like MongoDB may be appropriate for flexible schema and scalability.
For _donations, a relational database as it is a structured financial data, MySQL or PostgreSQL would be suitable.

2)Data Warehouse and ETL:
For the data warehouse, consider using cloud-based solutions like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake for scalability and performance.
ETL pipeline design involves extracting data from various databases, transforming it (e.g., aggregations, cleaning), and loading into the data warehouse using ETL tools like Apache Airflow, Talend, or custom scripts.

3)Optimized Schema for Churn Analysis:
For churn prediction, consider a star schema with a central fact table representing subscriptions and dimensional tables for users, plans, and time for efficient churn analysis.

4)Scripts for ETL Job:
ETL scripts should include steps for extracting data using SQL queries, Transforming data according to the warehouse schema, and loading into the warehouse using appropriate SQL statements or ETL tool functions.

5)Cloud Tools Selection:
Choose cloud tools based on factors like ease of integration, cost, scalability, and familiarity. Amazon Redshift and AWS Glue are popular for ETL, and Google BigQuery for the data warehouse can be a good choice too.

6)Architecture Diagram:
Create an architecture diagram illustrating the flow of data from source databases through the ETL pipeline to the data warehouse, emphasizing data transformation and storage stages.
